"""Pruned, principled mini model-scatter variant.

Keeps the mini model assumptions -- only the PyC synapses ``w_ff``, ``w_fb`` and
``w_lat`` learn (PV tuning ``W_pv`` / ``w_pv_lat`` is fixed), and per-cell noise is
injected only into the FF/FB initial weights, ``apical_drive_threshold`` and
``apical_gain_strength`` -- but replaces hand-assigned transition identities with
a small set of templates keyed by **tuning width** and PyC/PV feedforward strength:

  * ``silent``: near-silent FF drive. With no feedback it stays near the origin
    (small dNO/dO); with strong generalized feedback it is a feedback-driven
    occluded ("O") responder.
  * ``narrow`` (width 1): weak FF (anti-Hebbian) plasticity + a high apical drive
    threshold, so feedback can only *gain-modulate*. The non-adapted FF drive is
    amplified into a ``+NO`` response. Each narrow cell's single preferred
    stimulus is drawn at random per cell, so the familiar-vs-novel ``+NO``
    asymmetry **emerges** from the protocol (only the familiar images are shown
    during the plastic phase, so their FF adapts while the novel image's does not)
    rather than being hand-assigned to separate familiar/novel templates.
  * ``broad`` (width 2): a low apical drive threshold plus larger accumulated
    activity, so familiar FF adapts away (``-NO``) and the strengthened,
    generalized feedback drives the occluded response (``+O``). Each sampled
    broad cell is tuned to a random pair of the three images rather than all
    inputs.

Three principled choices distinguish this from the legacy templates: feedback is
always **generalized over the context channels a cell receives** (no hand-painted
per-channel weight asymmetry), narrow/broad tuning sets the feedback
drive-vs-gain regime, and the FF anti-Hebbian scale emerges from a slow
activity accumulator rather than a width-specific fixed factor.
Surround weights (``w_lat``, ``W_pv``, ``w_pv_lat``) are coupled per template;
only ``w_lat`` is plastic. PV feedforward tuning is sampled independently of PyC
tuning; every sampled PV is tuned to two images and less tuned to the third.

The width-class scalars and the mixture weights at the top of this file are the
tuning levers; everything downstream reuses ``run_model_scatter.py``.
